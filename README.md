Why MIT License?
I choose this Licencse instead other famous one like GPL because MIT allows other contributors to work on it and also able to monetize it.
However, I'll always get the credit being the author and I would never be liable If my code goes wrong. 

This is a project where the website is served with backend server.
To set up: we first have to generate the node_module folder by executing the command "npm install" on powershell. If there's an issue execute this "npm update" or "npm audit fix".
And after the node-modules get's generated then execute this code to start serving website "npm index.js".


Start the localhost:8008 on browser to start the website.
